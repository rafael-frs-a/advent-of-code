## Solution

To solve this problem, we don't actually have to try fitting the shapes together. If we check the input, we only have six possible shapes defined in a 3x3 matrix. All given cases are trivial: either impossible because the available area is smaller than the area that all shapes would require if broken into individual squares, or possible because the available area is large enough to fit all shapes without them having to fit together.

## Instructions

Add an `input.txt` file to the parent folder and run `cargo run` to see the result.
