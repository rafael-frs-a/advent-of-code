## Solution

To solve part two, we have to start with an initial joltage made from the first 12 digits in the line. Then, for each digit starting from the 13th, we generate 12 candidates instead of the two from part one. These can be generated by removing one digit from the current joltage and adding the new digit to the end. We then take the greatest of the 13 candidates, including the current joltage. At the end of the line, we add the current joltage to the result.

## Instructions

Add an `input.txt` file to the parent folder and run `cargo run` to see the result.
