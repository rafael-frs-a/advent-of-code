## Solution

To solve this problem, we can assume the input forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to count how many times we reach `"out"` starting from `"you"`.

## Instructions

Add an `input.txt` file to the parent folder and run `cargo run` to see the result.
