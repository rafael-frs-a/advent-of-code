    "To solve this problem, we can make a graph of all connected computers and identify all cycles composed of three computers. Then, we check if any of those computers' names start with \"t\" and, if so, increase the count. We then need to divide the final count by six, since there are six possible combinations in which each triangle is visited. To make handling the graph structure easier, I used [NetworkX](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/)."
