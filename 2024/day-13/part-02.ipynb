    "Given that each prize coordinate is increased by 10131013 and we no longer have the 100-button-hit restriction, the previous brute force approach no longer works. To solve this, the first step is to write each case as a set of equations:\n",

    "One great thing about the Advent of Code is that, since you're running the solution in your own environment, you can use external packages instead of relying solely on built-in methods. In this case, you can solve these equations using [SymPy](https://pypi.org/project/sympy/), a Python library for symbolic mathematics that handles complex equations.\n",
